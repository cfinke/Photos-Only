Photos Only is a WordPress plugin that causes your blog to show (you guessed it) only photos.

Photos in your media library will be automatically shown on the front end just as if you created posts for them, and any posts you've published will be hidden, because with this plugin, it's photos only.

Think of it like the easiest possible way to share a stream of photos online.  Just upload to the media library using the dashboard or your choice of mobile client, and the photos will be instantly published.
